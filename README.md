# pipcounter
An elegant python program to count dominoes and the colored pips for scoring a game

Run the code and be sure to try the images I shared to validate its working able to count pips... 

This program works best with a modern cell phone camera with images taken from directly over your dominoes.  

Hi res photos decent light required!
